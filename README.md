# **🚀 Artificial Intelligence Internship – Code Sentinel**

This repository contains the tasks and projects I completed during my Artificial Intelligence Internship at Code Sentinel.
The internship focused on applying Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and AI application development to real-world problems.

# **📌 Internship Overview**

Organization: Code Sentinel

Duration: 4 Weeks

Focus Areas: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, AI Web Apps

# **🧑‍💻 Completed Tasks**

**1️⃣ Linear Regression Model**

Built a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn

Predicted house prices based on features like area and number of rooms

Visualized predictions using matplotlib

**2️⃣ Classification Models**

Applied preprocessing (missing values, encoding, scaling)

Trained multiple classifiers: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN

Compared performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

**3️⃣ Neural Network with TensorFlow/Keras**

Built and trained a Deep Learning model on the MNIST dataset

Used hidden layers, activation functions, and dropout layers

Visualized training history (loss & accuracy curves)

**4️⃣ Custom Image Classifier with Transfer Learning**

Used MobileNetV2 / ResNet50 for transfer learning

Classified a custom dataset (e.g., Dogs vs Cats / Fruits)

Applied data augmentation & fine-tuning

Evaluated performance with confusion matrix

**5️⃣ AI-Powered Web App (Streamlit)**

Developed a web app with Streamlit

Users can upload images and get predictions from the trained model

Integrated trained classifier (from Task 4)

Optionally deployed on Hugging Face/Render
